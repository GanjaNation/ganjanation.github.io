# Master Grant Narrative  
## EV Shuttle for Grass Valley Farm

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Grass Valley Farm is advancing a new model of rural mobility and sustainable agricultural development in the Sierra Nevada foothills. This project proposes the acquisition and deployment of a zero-emission electric shuttle van to serve as a vital link between the farm, the community, and Sacramento International Airport (SMF). The vehicle will support daily operations, strengthen regional farm-to-table connections, and expand opportunities for agritourism, educational programs, and economic growth.

The EV shuttle addresses three pressing regional needs:

**(1) Rural Transportation Access**  
Grass Valley and the surrounding communities have limited transit options connecting residents, workers, and visitors to major transportation hubs. A clean, reliable shuttle service reduces barriers to mobility and enhances access to essential services and regional travel.

**(2) Agricultural and Farm-to-Table Development**  
The vehicle will support farm operations, local food distribution, culinary collaborations, and on-farm events. By transporting guests, chefs, produce, and supplies, the shuttle becomes an integral part of the local food ecosystem and the farm’s emerging agritourism programs.

**(3) Sustainable Tourism and Economic Revitalization**  
The EV shuttle creates a premium arrival experience for visitors attending farm tours, tastings, workshops, and seasonal events. Wrapped with the farm’s branding, it will serve as a mobile ambassador for regenerative agriculture, local food culture, and eco-tourism in Nevada County.

Through this project, Grass Valley Farm aims to reduce emissions, improve regional connectivity, support rural economic development, and model a scalable pathway for clean transportation in California’s agricultural communities. The initiative aligns directly with state and federal goals for zero-emission vehicles, rural mobility investment, climate resilience, and local food system strengthening.

## 2. Project Background & Regional Need

Grass Valley, located in Nevada County, is a rural agricultural region with a growing population and increasing interest in sustainable food systems, farm-to-table experiences, and eco-friendly tourism. Despite this growth, the region continues to face significant transportation challenges. Public transit options are limited, and no direct, dependable connection exists between the farm community and Sacramento International Airport (SMF), the major gateway for regional, national, and international travel.

For local residents, workers, and visitors, this gap presents barriers to mobility, employment, and tourism. Many travelers must arrange costly private transportation or rely on personal vehicles for airport travel, contributing to roadway congestion and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, Grass Valley Farm is expanding its role as a center for regenerative agriculture, local food culture, and agritourism. Demand is growing for:

- Farm tours and educational programs  
- On-farm events and seasonal gatherings  
- Farm-to-table dinners and culinary collaborations  
- Sustainable tourism experiences  
- Local food distribution and partnerships with regional chefs  

However, current transportation limitations restrict the farm’s ability to serve these growing needs efficiently, sustainably, and safely.

By adopting an electric shuttle vehicle, Grass Valley Farm will not only improve its own operational capacity but also fill a longstanding regional mobility gap, creating benefits for residents, visitors, and the broader Nevada County community.

## 3. Project Description

### 3.1 Overview of the EV Shuttle Program

Grass Valley Farm proposes to acquire a commercial electric van—such as the Chevrolet BrightDrop Zevo series—with a range of approximately 250–300 miles per charge and ample cargo/passenger capacity. The vehicle will be utilized in three primary operational modes:

1. **Airport Shuttle Service**  
   Providing scheduled or on-demand transportation between the farm and SMF, supporting local residents, farm staff, visiting partners, and agritourism guests.

2. **Agritourism & Event Support**  
   Transporting visitors for:
   - farm tours  
   - workshops  
   - tastings  
   - seasonal events  
   - culinary pop-ups and chef collaborations  

3. **Farm-to-Table & Operational Logistics**  
   Carrying farm goods, materials, chefs, equipment, and supplies for:
   - farm-to-table dinners  
   - local distribution  
   - market events  
   - community partnerships  

### 3.2 Vehicle Specifications (Example)

- Electric commercial van (e.g., BrightDrop Zevo 600 or similar)  
- Range: approx. 250–300 miles  
- Charging: Level 2 (240V) or Level 3 DC Fast Charging  
- Capacity: configurable for passengers + cargo  
- Zero tailpipe emissions  
- Low operating and maintenance costs  

### 3.3 Charging Infrastructure

A permanent Level 2 charging station will be installed at the farm. This supports daily charging, ensures reliable service, and positions the farm as a local EV infrastructure node.

### 3.4 Operational Strategy

The shuttle will operate on:

- Regular airport trip schedules  
- Event-based usage  
- Daily farm operations  
- Community-support trips as needed  

The vehicle will be maintained on-site with support from local EV service providers.
